# ottrsidekick Package:

The goal of `ottrsidekick` is to provide tools to convert from Bookdown content to Leanpub content and do some checks.

## Installation

You can install `ottrsidekick` from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jhudsl/ottrsidekick")
```


## Example

Within a bookdown repository, you can run the following command to convert your
content to a Leanpub-ready format.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ottrsidekick::bookdown_to_leanpub()
```

By default the output files will be sent to a `manuscript` folder which is what Leanpub looks for.

For an example of what this looks like, see [this template repository](https://github.com/jhudsl/ottrsidekick_Quizzes).
