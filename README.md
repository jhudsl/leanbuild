# Intro to ottr package

`ottr` converts an [OTTR course](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki) (Open-source Tools for Training Resources) into a files ready for upload to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs): [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/).

- Go to the [main OTTR guide](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki) for how to start creating courses with OTTR.
- [Read the ottr package documentation here](https://jhudatascience.org/ottr/docs/index.html).

## Required files:

Before you are ready to run `ottr`, you will need the following files (which are standard in a `Bookdown` repository):  
- a `_bookdown.yml` file which lists the `.Rmd` files that are to be rendered in a `rmd: ` category (see [example file](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Quizzes/blob/main/_bookdown.yml)).
- `.Rmd` files which contain the chapter content (including your `index.Rmd` file which `Bookdown` has).
- an `images` directory that contains any images that are referenced in the chapters.
- `.bib` file(s) to complete any citation renders (see [example file](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Quizzes/blob/main/book.bib)).

_Optionally:_
- [a `Book.txt` file](https://leanpub.com/lfm/read#leanpub-auto-booktxt-sampletxt-and-manuscript-files) which lists the order of the chapters/quiz files (this can be autogenerated with `ottr`) (see [example file](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Quizzes/blob/main/Book.txt)).
- a directory containing quizzes in the form of `.md` files which have been written using the [Markua formatting specifications](https://leanpub.com/markua/read#leanpub-auto-quizzes-and-exercises) (see [example folder](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Quizzes/tree/main/quizzes)).

Here's an example of what the Bookdown file set up (which ottr will look for) might be set up like:
```
A_Bookdown_Repo
├── _bookdown.yml
├── index.Rmd
├── 01-chapter_one.Rmd
├── docs
│   └── ...
├── references.bib
├── quizzes
│   ├── quiz_1.md
│   └── ...
├── resources/images
│   ├── some-figures.png
│   └── ...
└── Book.txt
```

## Using the example repository:

If you'd like to use our example repository you can fork it on Github and clone it to your own computer
[Follow these instructions to fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) and then you can clone it using a command like:  

```{sh}
git clone https://github.com/{organization}/OTTR_Quizzes.git
```
But replace `{organization}` with the location of your forked repository.

## Installing ottr:

You can install `ottr` from GitHub with:

You will need to use the remotes package (and will need to install it if you don't have it).
``` r
if (!("remotes" %in% installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("jhudsl/ottr")
```

## Setting up the Rmds and images folder:

Each of your Rmds needs to have this chunk of code in the beginning of the file:

`````{r}
```{r, include = FALSE}
ottr::set_knitr_image_path()
```
`````
This will ensure that the images are stored in the correct place and will be rendered correctly both in `Bookdown` and in Leanpub.

## Running ottr

The `ottr` package converts your files using this main function:

```{r}
ottr::bookdown_to_leanpub()
```

By default, `ottr` will re-run a `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")` rendering of your chapters first before converting the files to the Leanpub ready format.
However, if you wish to skip this step, you can set `render = FALSE` when running the `ottr::bookdown_to_leanpub()` function.

## About the Book.txt file:

Leanpub requires a [`Book.txt`](https://leanpub.com/lfm/read#leanpub-auto-booktxt-sampletxt-and-manuscript-files) file to know what order the chapters/quizzes should be published.

By default, your `Book.txt` file will _not_ be autogenerated but `ottr` will look in your given directory for an existing `Book.txt` file which it will copy over to the output directory.

You can create a `Book.txt` file manually, or if your quizzes and chapters are numbered, `ottr` can create the `Book.txt` file based on the numbers going from low to high and quizzes following chapters of the same number.
(e.g. `quiz_03.md` will be placed after `03-some_chapter_file.Rmd`).

To have `ottr` attempt to autogenerate this file, set `make_book_txt` to `TRUE`.

```{r}
ottr::bookdown_to_leanpub(make_book_txt = TRUE)
```

If no `Book.txt` file is found and `make_book_txt` is set to `FALSE` (this is the default setting), `ottr` will fail.

A ottr autogenerated `Book.txt` file might look something like this:
```
index.Rmd
01-chapter.Rmd
quiz_1.md
02-chapter.Rmd
quiz_2.md
about.Rmd
```
Also note that any `index.Rmd` will always be placed first and any `about.Rmd` file will be placed last.

## Setting up quizzes:

By default, ottr will look for a folder called `quizzes/` to find your quiz `.md` files.
If your quizzes are located somewhere else, you will need to use the `quiz_dir` argument to specify that:

```{r}
ottr::bookdown_to_leanpub(quiz_dir = "some_directory")
```

## About the output files

Leanpub's Github writing mode will look for a directory called `manuscript` to publish from.
You should not edit the files in `manuscript/` by hand since a re-run of `ottr` will cause your changes to be overwritten.

## Adding footer text:

If there is text you would like added to the end of each chapter (like a link to a feedback survey for example), you can supply a character string to the `footer_text`argument in the main `ottr::bookdown_to_leanpub()` function.

```{r}
# Set up a character string
survey_link <- "Please provide any feedback you have in [this survey](www.some_link.org)"

# Supply the footer text in the main function
ottr::bookdown_to_leanpub(footer_text = survey_link)
```
